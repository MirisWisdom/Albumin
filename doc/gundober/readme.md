# Gundober YouTube Channels

The channels are what inspired this project! Unfortunately, though unsurprisingly, the channels have been taken down. Luckily, my smarter past self has preserved the metadata as much as possible.

Please refer to the following documents:

- [Gundober01 YouTube Channel: Uploaded Videos](./gundober01-videos.md)
- [Gundober01 YouTube Channel: Track / Anime Listing](./gundober01-titles.md)
- [Gundober02 YouTube Channel: Uploaded Videos](./gundober02-videos.md)
- [Gundober03 YouTube Channel: Uploaded Videos](./gundober03-videos.md)

The intent was to use this metadata for preserving the videos down the line, though bandwidth and low disk capacity were an obstacle. For what it's worth, the metadata may help in finding the original songs!
