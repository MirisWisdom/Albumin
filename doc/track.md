# Track

A song within an [album](./album.md) that is:

1. [extracted](./intermediate.md) from a YouTube or local video; and
2. [encoded](./encoding.md) into an audio MP3/FLAC/OGG file; and
3. contains track metadata and a [cover art](./cover.md).

On top of the metadata, a track represents its title, track number in the album, and starting + ending times.

## Metadata

Metadata refers to the additional information which is embedded into an encoded audio file. Albumin, at the moment, supports the following tags:

- Album title
- Cover art
- Genre
- Comment
- Artists

Metadata can be mass assigned through parameters when invoking Albumin. Each individual track's metadata can be granularly edited in the [compiled `.gun` file](./compiling.md) before the [encoding](./encoding.md) process.

### Comment

If a [track](./track.md) has a blank comment, Albumin will attempt to assign the YouTube video URL as the comment. This can only be possible if:

A. The source is a YouTube URL; or
B. The local file has a YouTube ID as its name

For the local file name to be acknowledged as a YouTube ID, it must be 11 characters long, with only alphanumeric/dashes/underscores being used.

## Ending Time

The ending time of a track is the *subsequent track's* **starting time**:

```
01 0:00:00 All You Need Is Love - track 1
   |-----|
         +----------------------- STARTING TIME FOR TRACK 1

02 0:12:23 LOVE SOMEBODY        - track 2
   |-----|
         +----------------------- STARTING TIME FOR TRACK 2, ENDING TIME FOR TRACK 1
```

An ending time can be explicitly assigned in the [compiled `.gun` file](./compiling.md) before the [encoding](./encoding.md) process.

## File Name

The encoded track name adheres to the "No. Title.ext" extension, e.g.:

- `01. All You Need Is Love - 田村直美 「レイアース」OVA版主題歌.mp3`
- `05. 僕であるために - FLYING KIDS 「逮捕しちゃうぞ」一期OP2.flac`

The title will be normalised before being assigned as the file name. Normalisation is simply the removal of the following characters:

- `<`
- `>`
- `:`
- `\`
- `/`
- `\`
- `|`
- `?`
- `*`

This ensures that the files are safe to keep on Windows and Linux filesystems.
