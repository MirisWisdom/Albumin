# Gunloader Web UI

This project lets you generate instructions for the Gunloader CLI to download and split up videos into separate audio track files. It is a simple companion to the main CLI app, with the intent of being accessible from any device.

Long, hours-long video compilations without existing track times are a challenge to split up. As such, this website allows anyone to optionally publish the track times for a video and letting others benefit from the effort.
