This project lets you generate instructions for the Gunloader CLI to download and split up videos into separate audio track files. It is a simple companion to the main CLI app, with the intent of being accessible from any device.

Long, hours-long video compilations without existing track times are a challenge to split up. As such, this website allows anyone to optionally publish the track times for a video and letting others benefit from the effort.

# Usage

1. Go to the Web UI, and provide a YouTube URL.
2. If somebody already created a record, you can copy the ID for it.
3. Otherwise, create a new record with song information and timings.
4. Run the [Gunloader CLI](https://github.com/yumiris/Gunloader/) and provide the ID shown in the Web GUI.

## Dependencies

Please refer to the main [Gunloader CLI page](https://github.com/yumiris/Gunloader/) for further information.
